    "- Identifying representative environmental conditions for numerical modeling\n",

    "In this notebook, we demonstrate how to:\n",
    "1. Apply MDA to select representative sea state cases from a long-term dataset\n",
    "2. Use these cases to reconstruct data at a different location\n",
    "3. Evaluate reconstruction performance using different interpolation methods\n",
