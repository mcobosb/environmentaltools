    "This example analyzes the multivariate time series of the water current field (mean current velocity, U, and mean incoming current direction, DirU) hindcasted at 0.5058 m below the mean sea level at a point located in 35.916º N, 5.5º W at the Strait of Gibraltar (data provided by [Marine Copernicus System](\\href{https://marine.copernicus.eu/)). The hindcast time series has≈27 years duration, with data that spans from 1993/01/01 to 2019/12/31 with a daily temporal cadence. The IBI (Iberian Biscay Irish) Ocean Reanalysis system provides 3D ocean fields (product identifier \"IBI_MULTIYEAR_PHY_005_002\"). The IBI model numerical core is based on the NEMO v3.6 ocean general circulation model run at 1/12º horizontal resolution. The steps will be the following: \n",
