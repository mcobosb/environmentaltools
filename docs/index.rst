Welcome to Environmentaltools's documentation!
==============================================

**Environmentaltools** is a comprehensive Python package designed for environmental data analysis and visualization. 
It provides a collection of tools for processing, analyzing, and visualizing environmental time series, spatial data, 
and statistical distributions.

This package originated as a compendium of functions developed to address specific problems in coastal and estuarine 
maritime engineering. The functions are being generalized and continuously improved to be useful in many other contexts, 
including climate analysis, hydrological studies, and broader environmental data science applications.

The tool is developed by Manuel Cobos (https://github.com/mcobosb) as part of the **Environmental Fluid Dynamics (GDFA)** 
team of the University of Granada. The GDFA wishes a good experience in the learning process. Enjoy it!
